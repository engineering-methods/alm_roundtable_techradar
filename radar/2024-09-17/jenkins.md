[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) is an open-source automation server that helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

It provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.

The blip-author stated that they're really happy with it and it works quite well for them.
The usage is ever increasing in the company.

One caveat though is that keeping Jenkins up-to-date can be a bit of a hassle, especially when using many plugins.
