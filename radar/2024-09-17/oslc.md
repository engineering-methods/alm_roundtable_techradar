[OSLC](https://open-services.net/) (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) is a set of specifications that define how different software tools can interoperate and exchange data. OSLC is based on web standards and RESTful APIs, making it easy to integrate tools from different vendors and domains. It provides a common data model and vocabulary for representing artifacts and relationships, enabling seamless collaboration and traceability across the software development lifecycle.
