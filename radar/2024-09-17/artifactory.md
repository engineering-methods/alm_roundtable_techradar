[JFrog Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/artifactory/) is used to store and manage dependencies, artifacts, and build outputs in a centralized repository. It supports various package formats, including Maven, Docker, npm, NuGet, PyPI, Conan and more. It also integrates with popular build tools and CI/CD systems, enabling seamless automation of the software development lifecycle.

The blip-author recommends that tool because it has become a central backbone for the company's software development process. They're using conan packages in embedded development, python packages in tooling, docker images and even binary packages long term archiving.
