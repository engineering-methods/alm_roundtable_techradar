[DynaTrace](https://www.dynatrace.com/) is an application performance monitoring tool that provides insights into the performance of applications and services. It helps organizations to identify performance bottlenecks, errors, and other issues that impact the user experience. DynaTrace can be used to monitor applications running on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid environments.

The blip author's company is using DynaTrace for monitoring their Windchill installation and are quite happy with it. However in the context of Windchill, DynaTrace isn't bundled anymore and the company is looking for other alternatives for their future stack.
