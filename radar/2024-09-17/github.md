[Github](https://github.com) is a web-based platform for version control using Git.
It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

The blip-autor especially mentioned the pipelines (Github Actions) and the pages (hosting documentation) features as valuable.
It is used on-prem (self-hosted) internally as well as externally (cloud, SaaS) for open source projects and to collaborate with externals and customers.
