[Windchill](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/plm/windchill) is a product lifecycle management (PLM) software that helps organizations manage product data, documents, and processes throughout the product development lifecycle. It provides capabilities for managing requirements, change management, configuration management, and collaboration.

The blip author's company is using Windchill for ECN (Engineering Change Notice) management, ECR (Engineering Change Request) management, etc, and they are satisfied with the tool.

For software development Codebeamer is their choice, however integrating these two, or general the software/alm and plm processes and tools is a challenge.
