The blip author is seeing a trend to use [Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-as-a-Service) more and more in their company. SaaS is a cloud-based software delivery model where applications are hosted and maintained by third-party providers and accessed over the internet. This approach
can offer several key benefits for businesses:

* It is cost-efficient, eliminating the need for expensive upfront hardware and software investments, instead providing a subscription model that turns these into predictable operational expenses.
* It offers scalability and flexibility, allowing companies to easily adjust services as needed without the hassle of upgrading infrastructure.
* SaaS ensures accessibility from anywhere with an internet connection, while providers handle maintenance and updates, keeping systems up to date with minimal effort.

However, there are are some caveats:

* Data security is a concern, as sensitive information is stored on third-party servers, raising risks around privacy and vendor-managed security protocols.
* The ongoing costs of subscription fees can add up over time, and vendor lock-in makes switching providers difficult due to complex data migration processes.
* Customization can be limited, meaning that SaaS may not meet all of a businessâ€™s unique needs, forcing some adaptation. This is one area where the blip author sees problems in using SaaS.
