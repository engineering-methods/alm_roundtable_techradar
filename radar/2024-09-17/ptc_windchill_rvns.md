[PTC RV&S](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/rv-s) is an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool that supports agile and traditional development processes. It provides capabilities for requirements management, test management, and version control. PTC RV&S is designed to help teams collaborate, manage, and track the entire product development lifecycle.

Several attendees at the workshop are using PTC RV&S in production right now, but plan to migrate to other systems like Codebeamer or Polarion. While PTC RV&S has no end of life announced, the attendees feel that the tool isn't evolving anymore as PTC also has Codebeamer in their Portfolio.

One point to keep in mind though is that even though RV&S and Codebeamer are both tools of the same company there is no direct migration path between the two tools.
