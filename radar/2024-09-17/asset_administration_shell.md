[Asset Administration Shell](https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/technologie) (AAS) is a key concept in the [Industry 4.0 initiative](https://www.plattform-i40.de/IP/Navigation/DE/Industrie40/WasIndustrie40/was-ist-industrie-40.html). It is a digital representation of a physical asset or a group of assets, providing a standardized way to describe and manage assets throughout their lifecycle. AAS defines a common language and data model for exchanging information between assets and systems, enabling seamless integration and interoperability in smart factories.

This is a promising concept and we had some discussion around digital twin in general.
There was some consense that the success of the AAS is dependant on the quality and adoption of the defined submodels. Right now, at time of this writing (09/2024) 26 published submodels (89 total) are available on the IDTA site.
