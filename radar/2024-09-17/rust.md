[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a system programming language with modern affordances. It features a rich typing system, safe memory model and task-based concurrency. Compared to C++, it guarantees memory safety and thread safety, and it does not have a garbage collector. This makes it a good choice for systems programming, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications.

It ever continues to grow in popularity and has been voted Stack Overflow's "most loved" language by developers several years in a row. On first look we like it too. It's a fast, safe and expressive language that is increasing in utility as its ecosystem grows.

There is even an ISO26262 (ASIL D) and IEC 61508 (SIL 4) certified Rust compiler available: [Ferrocene](https://ferrocene.dev/de/).

It is an interesting language and we are looking forward to seeing how this language evolves.
