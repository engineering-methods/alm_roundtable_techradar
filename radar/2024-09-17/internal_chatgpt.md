Using an on premise version [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) internally to provide support and knowledge sharing. It helps to answer common questions, provide guidance, and share information across teams. 

The blip-author recommends using ChatGPT for internal knowledge sharing and support. Especially when trained with company-specific data, it has been a a valuable tool for employees to get quick answers and support so far. This also helps to prevent data braeaches as employees do not have to rely on official ChatGPT service, where they could accidentally share internal information, and still have the benefits of AI support.

The answers can be non-deterministic however, and the tool is still in a trial phase to evaluate its long-term benefits and potential drawbacks.
