[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed event streaming platform that is capable of handling trillions of events a day. It is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka is horizontally scalable, fault-tolerant, and provides high throughput and low latency.

The blip-author's company is considering using Kafka as Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) for event-driven architecture and real-time data processing. It is seen as a potential solution for integrating various systems and applications, and for building scalable and reliable data pipelines.
