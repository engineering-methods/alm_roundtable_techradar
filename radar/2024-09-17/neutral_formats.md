Neutral formats are file formats that are designed to be easily readable and editable by both humans and machines. They are typically based on plain text and are free from proprietary or platform-specific features. Neutral formats are widely used in software development for storing data, configuration, and other information.

We came to the conclusion that neutral formats should be used as often as possible to:

- reduce vendor lock-in
- increase interoperability
- maintain long-term compatibility

Markup languages ([Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), [reStructuredText](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText), [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/)) for documentation (see also docs-as-code blip), [JT](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/plm-components/jt/) (jupiter tesselation) for 3D-data, [ReqIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_Interchange_Format) for requirements etc. or just structured general formats like [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) should be utilized whenever possible.
