[CodeBeamer](https://intland.com/products/codebeamer-alm/) is an Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool that supports agile and traditional development processes. It provides capabilities for requirements management, test management, and version control. CodeBeamer is designed to help teams collaborate, manage, and track the entire product development lifecycle.

The blip author's company is currently evaluating CodeBeamer as a replacement for their existing ALM tool (PTC Windchill RV&S).

Several other attendees at the workshop are also using CodeBeamer in the automative / mechanical engineering industry.
