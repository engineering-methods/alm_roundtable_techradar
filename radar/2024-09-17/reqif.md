[ReqIF](https://www.omg.org/spec/ReqIF/) is a standard for exchanging requirements between tools. It is based on XML and is widely used in the automotive and aerospace industries. ReqIF is a powerful tool for managing requirements and ensuring that they are consistent and up-to-date.

The blip authors company and other attendees are utilizing ReqIF to exchange requirements between different tools, suppliers etc.

Some attendees however also had bad experiences with reqif, most of them on the implementation side because despite being a standard it has many degrees of freedom, so most requirement tools implements it slightly differently. Still often it is the only option to exchange requirements therefore it's on the adopt ring.
