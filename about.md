# ALM Roundtable 2024 Technology Radar

## Introduction

Technology is advancing rapidly, with new technologies and innovations constantly emerging.

It is essential for development and technology companies to continually improve and keep track of the latest valuable innovations. It is important to actively seek out innovations and new technologies and periodically question established technologies and methods.

But, it is also important to wisely choose which technologies to use in our daily work and in the different projects we are carrying out. As we all know: There is no silver bullet.

## What is the ALM Roundtable Technology Radar?

The Tech Radar provides an overview of different technologies in the categories of languages + frameworks, tools, techniques, and platforms and operations. We consider these 'new or noteworthy.' The radar does not cover all established technologies; instead, it focuses on items that have recently gained significance or undergone changes. Items previously featured in the radar are not listed on the homepage but remain available in the complete overview and search.

## How it is/was created

This technology radar was created at our [ALM Roundtable 2024](https://www.em.ag/alm-roundtable/) event on September 17th, 2024. We had a great mix of people from different industries and roles
in the audience to share our thoughts on the current state of technology.

Thanks to all attendees for their contributions!! ðŸŽ‰

## How should it be used

The radar serves as an overview of technologies that the audience of the workshop found interesting and valuable and that they would recommend to others, or in case of technologies "on hold" would recommend to avoid.

Its goal is to guide and inspire daily work within the teams. Additionally, it aims to provide valuable information and a high-level perspective to enable decisions to be made with a deeper understanding of the subject matter, resulting in more informed and coordinated choices.

The items are categorized into four quadrants, and sometimes, when it's not entirely clear where an item belongs, we choose the best fit.

### The quadrants are

* **Languages & Frameworks**: Programming languages, frameworks and libraries
* **Tools**: Tools supporting the application lifecycle management
* **Techniques**: Methods and techniques in ALM
* **Platforms & Operations**: In this quadrant, we group technologies related to the operation of software, infrastructure, and platform-related tools and services.

### Each of the items is classified in one of these rings

* **Adopt**: For us itâ€˜s proven and mature and we recommend it.
* **Trial**: We have already used/evaluated it but itâ€™s not yet proven and ready for adopt ring.
* **Assess**: Worth keeping an eye on. Not yet tried.
* **Hold**: We donâ€˜t use this anymore for several reasons. This can still be a good technology but not for us.
